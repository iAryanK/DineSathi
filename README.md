## Features

The app implements the signup, login-logout system, while saving the user credentials in the shared preferences.
It fetches data from the api provided by Internshala and render it to show restaurant list and menu as shown in the attached images.

## Learnings

Beginning with new programming language i.e. Kotlin, I learnt how to implement the signup/signin feature in an application using shared preferences and creating local database using room persistence library.
I also learnt the process of creation of UI using XML.
